/*
Why Does This Work?
- Since you are marking the presence of numbers directly in the input array, thereâ€™s no need for additional space to store which numbers were seen.
- By negating the value at an index, you effectively mark that the number i + 1 exists in the array.
- By leaving unmarked (positive) values in the array, you can later identify which numbers are missing


nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
1. '4' is present in nums. Mark as present by negating nums[4-1] = nums[3].  Thus, nums[3] = -7
   => nums = [4,3,2,-7,8,2,3,1]
	
2. '3' is present in nums. Mark as present by negating nums[3-1] = nums[2].  Thus, nums[2] = -2
   => nums = [4,3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1]

3. '2' is present in nums. nums[2-1] = nums[1].Thus, nums[1] = -3
   => nums = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,3,1]
   
4. '7' is present in nums. nums[7-1] = nums[6].Thus, nums[6] = -3
   => nums = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,1]

5. '8' is present in nums. nums[8-1] = nums[7] .Thus, nums[7] = -1
   => nums = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]
   
6. '2' is present in nums. .Thus, nums[1] = -3
   => nums = [4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]   
  
7. '3' is present in nums. nums[3-1] = nums[2] .Thus, nums[2] = -2
   => nums = [4,-3,-2,-7,8, 2,-3,-1]   

7. '1' is present in nums. nums[1-1] = nums[0].Thus, nums[0] = -4
   => nums = [-4,-3,-2,-7,8,2,-3,-1]   

Now, the only elements nums[i] which are positive are those where 'i+1' is not found in nums array
These are => nums[4] and nums[5].
That means 5 and 6 an not present in the initial nums array
