/*
Example
Using the earlier example:

0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
â€‹

Here's how the previous and current arrays evolve:

The function's output matches the example description:

Initial State:

previous: [1,0,0]
current: [0,0,0] => j=0 -> [1,0,0] => j=1 -> [1,1,0] => j=2 -> [1,1,1]
After processing row 0:

previous: [1,0,0]
current: [1,1,1]
After processing row 1:

previous: [1,1,1]
current: [1,0,1]
After processing row 2:

previous: [1,0,1]
current: [1,1,2]
From the final state of the previous array, we can infer that there are 2 unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, avoiding obstacles. This matches the expected result.
